      # Start backends before frontend (doesn't guarantee readiness, just start order)
      - caption
      - object
    # --- IMPORTANT: Environment variables for Frontend ---
    # Pass the internal URLs of the backend services to the frontend container
    # Your React/Vue/etc app needs to be configured to read these env vars
    # (e.g., process.env.REACT_APP_CAPTION_API_URL)
    environment:
      # The frontend JS will call http://caption:8000/api/...
      - REACT_APP_CAPTION_API_URL=http://ai-tools/api
      # The frontend JS will call http://object:8002/api/detect...
      - REACT_APP_OBJECT_API_URL=http://ai-tools/api/
      # Add other env vars the frontend needs, like NODE_ENV=production if applicable

# --- Define Network ---
networks:
  ai_tools_network:
    driver: bridge # Default Docker network driver

# --- Optional: Define Named Volumes for Persistent Cache ---
